Assignment 1
Phone contact book management
This programming assignment will give you practice with the Java data structures, sorting and
searching techniques. You are going to write a class that contains a number of the phone book
operations. A phone book may contain 0-N contacts; the operations that the users shall be able to
do are:
1. save(..)  to save a new contact, (2 Marks)
If a contact exists under the same name, you should get a message to notify you that another
contact under that name exists – You should change a different contact name.
2. display()  to show the list of existing contacts (1 Mark)
The list of contacts should be shown in groups in alphabetical order (A,a – Z, z).
Example:
A
_________________
Ali
ara
B
__________________
Bahra
Baran
3. call(..)  to call a contact (2 Marks)
For example, assume you want to call a contact saved as Sara; you should first try to find the
contact saved under that name, if the name is in the list of contacts, show a message.
For example: “Calling Sara……You called Sara successfully”.
Otherwise show “No results for Sara”
4. recent(..)  to display the list of recent calls, which includes the name of contacts that have
been called recently. The name of the most recent contacts should be on the top of the list. (2
Marks)
5. delete()  to delete contact details through using the contact names. (1 Mark)
6. modify(..)  to modify an existing contact. (1 Mark)
7. The time complexity of each operation should be written as a comment before the operation.
(1 Mark)
Assumptions:
The contacts consist of the firstname and phone number.
All the operations should work on the firstname.
Note:
 Unnecessary operations will affect your grade.
 Choosing a wrong data structure will affect your whole grade.
 Built-in data structures are not allowed to be used. You will get ZERO if you the
built-in techniques or data structures.
 Improper complexity will affect your grade.
 You will lose points if exceptions occur in your project.
